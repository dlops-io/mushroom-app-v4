# Mushroom App - Automation

In this tutorial we will put all the components we built for our Mushroom App together. We will then apply Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) methods to test, execute, monitor, deploy, and scale these components. All of these steps will be automated based on workflow using GitHub Actions. Here are the components we have built for our Mushroom App:

* Data Collector: Scraps image from the internet and stores them into a `raw` folder.
* Data Processor: Checks images for duplicates, validate image formats, converts images to TF Records
* Model Training: Submits training jobs to Vertex AI to train models
* Model Deploy: Updates trained models signature with preprocessing logic added to it. Upload model to Vertex AI Model Registry and Deploy model to Model Endpoints.
* API Service: FastAPI service to expose APIs to the frontend.
* Frontend:  React Frontend for the mushroom app.
